# Assembly Balloon Shooter
A common popular game named 'Balloon Shooter' is developed here using intel 8086 assembly language . We tried to make it enjoyable. Very simple graphics contents were used. We used just 2 colors. One for background and another for ballon , bullet and pin. A sound function was also added. Maximum 10 bullets player can shoot. If it hits a balloon, score will be increased.Initially score will be 0. Within a given time player has to shoot as much balloon as possible.
